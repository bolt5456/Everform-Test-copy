# Fresh Start with Dawn Theme ✅

## What Just Happened

I replaced the broken custom theme with **Shopify's official Dawn theme** (latest version).

### Why This is Better

**The old theme had fundamental problems:**
- ❌ No images configured (empty hero sections)
- ❌ No products to display
- ❌ Untested Liquid code
- ❌ Built in isolation without testing in Shopify
- ❌ Result: Just text on white background

**Dawn theme benefits:**
- ✅ **Official Shopify theme** - battle-tested and production-ready
- ✅ **Works perfectly out of the box** - you'll see a beautiful site immediately
- ✅ **Modern design** - clean, professional, responsive
- ✅ **Full OS 2.0 architecture** - sections and blocks you can customize
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - fast loading, accessible
- ✅ **Complete feature set** - all sections you need already built

## Next Steps - Test Then Customize

### STEP 1: Upload Dawn to Shopify (DO THIS FIRST)

1. **Zip the theme:**
   - Select all folders in this directory (assets, config, layout, locales, sections, snippets, templates)
   - Right-click → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder
   - Name it `dawn-everform.zip`

2. **Upload to Shopify:**
   - Go to your Shopify admin
   - Online Store → Themes
   - Click "Add theme" → "Upload zip file"
   - Select `dawn-everform.zip`
   - Click "Publish" to make it live

3. **Test it works:**
   - Visit your store
   - You should see a beautiful, working website immediately
   - All sections should render properly
   - Everything should be clickable and functional

### STEP 2: Add Sample Products (If You Don't Have Any)

Dawn needs products to look good. If you don't have products yet:

1. Go to Products → Add product
2. Create 4-6 sample products with:
   - Product images (use placeholder images or real product photos)
   - Product titles
   - Prices
   - Basic descriptions

This will make the homepage "Featured Collection" section populate.

### STEP 3: Customize Step-by-Step (After Testing Dawn Works)

Once Dawn is working perfectly, we'll customize it for Everform:

**Priority 1: VAT Pricing System (CRITICAL)**
- Add Ex VAT + Inc VAT display to product pages
- Show both prices on collection pages
- Update cart to show VAT pricing
- Test thoroughly with products

**Priority 2: Branding**
- Update colors to Everform teal (#183E3F)
- Change fonts to Archivo/Questrial
- Upload Everform logo
- Customize footer with Everform contact info

**Priority 3: Homepage Customization**
- Customize hero banner with Everform imagery
- Add featured collections (Corten planters, Aluminium copings)
- Add contact form section
- Add trust badges/certifications

**Priority 4: Product Page Enhancements**
- Add technical specifications section
- Add size charts for relevant products
- Add engineering drawings upload
- Add installation guide accordions

**Priority 5: Additional Pages**
- Services page
- Projects gallery
- Request quotation form
- About page

## The Right Approach This Time

Instead of building everything at once, we'll:

1. ✅ **Start with working foundation** (Dawn theme)
2. ✅ **Test after EACH change** in Shopify
3. ✅ **Make small, incremental improvements**
4. ✅ **Verify everything works before moving on**

## Current Status

✅ Dawn theme downloaded and committed to git
✅ Old broken theme backed up to `old-broken-theme/` folder
⏳ Waiting for you to upload to Shopify and test

## What You Should See When You Upload Dawn

- **Homepage**: Beautiful hero banner (with placeholder or your images)
- **Featured products**: Product grid if you have products
- **Navigation**: Working header with menu
- **Footer**: Professional footer with links
- **Product pages**: Full-featured product layout
- **Cart**: Working shopping cart
- **Everything responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop

## Questions?

Let me know:
1. Did Dawn upload successfully?
2. Does the theme look good when you preview it?
3. Do you have products in your store, or do we need to add sample ones?
4. Ready to start with Priority 1 (VAT pricing)?

**This is the right approach.** Starting with a working foundation means we can customize with confidence, testing each change along the way.
